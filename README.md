A silly set of JS examples

[Step 1](./Step%201/index.html) - Wiring up a basic html page that doesn't do anything.

[Step 2](./Step%202/index.html) - Adding some basic markup for a page editor that still doesn't do anything.

[Step 3](./Step%203/index.html) - Wiring up a little bit of Knockout to magically update other things.

[Step 4](./Step%204/index.html) - Adding Postal.js to publish messages when the form submits.

[Step 5](./Step%205/index.html) - And then adding a super basic Backbone piece that interacts.

[Step 6](./Step%206/index.html) - Adding an event to remove a post.

[Step 7](./Step%207/index.html) - Fixing the issue where removed posts aren't really removed from the collection.
